    <h2> How does a takeover function?</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">By next school year, the Houston Independent School District will have new leaders, but little is known yet about what exactly this will mean for students, staff and parents in the district.

      State Education Commissioner Mike Morath said Wednesday that he will appoint a board of managers to temporarily replace the locally elected Houston ISD board of trustees. This comes after years of scrutiny of the district by the Texas Education Agency because of repeated low student performance at Phillis Wheatley High School and allegations of misconduct by previous trustees.
      
      The board of managers would be in charge of the school boards duties, which include approving a school budget and tax rate and setting district policies in areas like school safety and instruction, as allowed under state and federal laws.
      <br>
      The TEA oversees roughly 1,200 school districts and grades them on academic performance, largely based on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, known as STAAR tests. Under state law, the state education commissioner can intervene in the leadership of school districts if they are underperforming.For example, the commissioner can appoint a conservator to oversee a district or campus, but the district’s school board and superintendent could remain in place.

      The commissioner can also suspend and temporarily replace a school districts elected leaders with a board of managers if a district fails to meet accreditation, academic performance or financial standards.
      
      When the TEA takes over, the power of the school board is suspended and given to a state-appointed board of managers. In a job description posted online related to Houston ISD, the TEA outlined that the essential job functions for the nine managers replacing the school board would include using data and input from stakeholders to “monitor and support” the superintendent.

      The current school board members can continue serving in an advisory capacity, like other community members, but they would have to be reelected to remain trustees. Once the commissioner decides to end the appointment of the board of managers, the most recently elected school board members will be phased into governing the school district.

    <h3>Why is HISD being taken over?    </h3>
    <div class="center-container">
    <p class="centered-text"> Houston leaders overwhelmingly opposed the takeover, citing HISD’s overall B rating from the state and strong financial position. In 2019 the district sued the state, delaying the takeover for four years. The legal battle ended in January, when the Texas Supreme Court—whose nine members are all Republicans—sided with the TEA. 
      <br>
      <br>
      On June 1, the TEA formally seized control of HISD. Governor Greg Abbott, who appointed Morath (as well as five state Supreme Court justices), called the decision “unfortunate” but necessary. “There has been a longtime failure by HISD, and the victims of that failure are the students,” Abbott declared. HISD superintendent Millard House II, who had been on the job for two years, was replaced by Miles, a former Dallas ISD superintendent and the founder of Third Future Schools, a network of public charter schools. The elected trustees were replaced by a board of managers picked by the TEA. While racially diverse, the board members mostly live in affluent areas of Houston west of downtown, far from the schools in northeast Houston targeted by Miles’s reforms. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Those reforms will be sweeping and immediate. For his first year, Miles will target the feeder systems of three chronically underperforming high schools: Kashmere, North Forest, and Wheatley. A total of 29 elementary, middle, and high schools—all serving low-income, predominantly minority student populations—will be reorganized according to Miles’s “New Education System,” a package of reforms he implemented at Dallas ISD and his Third Future schools. In coming years, Miles plans to expand this system to more campuses. (Miles’s tenure in Dallas was polarizing. Supporters claim he made extraordinary improvements, while critics say he alienated the community and that academic gains proved short-lived.)

        Affects on students
      </h6>

      <div class="center-container2">
        <p class="centered-text2"> The Texas Education Agency confirmed its plans to remove all nine members of Houston Independent School District’s democratically elected school board, as well as its superintendent Millard House II. The district, with roughly 190,000 students — about 85% of whom are Hispanic and Black, will become the largest to be taken over by TEA.
          <br>
          <br>
          The state’s takeover comes as more than 270 campuses and schools continue to grapple with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

          After struggling with remote learning for two years, Ivona Washington, now a senior at Lamar High School, said it took her months to get back into socializing at school.
          
          For many students, she says, teachers serve as an important adult figure in their lives. She worries that connection could be lost during the takeover if teachers are tasked with focusing on other priorities.
          
          
          <br>
          <br>
          “They just threw us right back into school and now they want us to start doing amazing,” Washington said. “If I go to school and my teachers only care about me as a test score for money, I can feel that and you don’t want to be there.”

The school district needs its students and teachers supported with resources — not taken over by state-appointed individuals, said Caoilin Krathaus, a junior at Carnegie Vanguard High School.

“My classmates and I and all of HISD students need adults that represent us and care deeply about our education, our concerns and not our financial value,” Krathaus said at a news conference held by the Houston Federation of Teachers, the district’s largest union.
<br>
<br>
Phillis Wheatley High School — the campus whose poor performance state officials say triggered the takeover — sits in Houston’s Fifth Ward, where several residents said Wednesday they were skeptical of the state’s intentions for taking over. They questioned the timing of the state’s intervention because the school has improved its performance — even after the pandemic — and the district overall performs better than many other districts in Texas.

Others said they hoped the district would be spared of too many sudden changes after finding a sense of stability following a decade defined by various scandals, including the start of the yearslong legal fight with the state about the takeover.

But on Wednesday as the schools were out for spring break, many questions remained.

The district is one of the Houston area’s largest employers with nearly 30,000 full- and part-time workers, yet several said they were not certain how the takeover may affect their lives. The same went for several HISD parents and students.

<h5>
  Future of HISD Students
</h5>

<div class="center-container3">
  <p class="centered-text3"> In a meeting this afternoon, Governor Greg Abbott denied allegations that the takeover is connected to his recent legislative push to create more parental choice through a school voucher program.

    "All that is completely separate from what is happening with HISD,” he said.Instead, the takeover will make sure Houston schools will “no longer be failing their students,” the governor said.

    “There has been a longtime failure by HISD and the victims of the failure are the students,” Abbott said, adding that we need to "come together and reinvent HISD in a way that will ensure that we are providing the best possible education for those kids."

    Nyla McCullum, an 18-year-old senior at Wheatley High School, said she saw the news about the takeover on TV at her grandma’s house. Although she’s about to graduate, she worries about what the takeover might mean for her younger classmates.

    She thinks that state leaders should focus more on student well-being rather than the state’s best interests.
    
    “I don't think their main focus is the students,” she said about the Texas education agency. “It’s like they’re making decisions based on them, not based on students.”
    
    McCullum said she chose to keep attending Wheatley even after moving away from the Fifth Ward community. The high school has a long tradition of greatness, she said, and the school has offered wonderful opportunities in the last four years. The senior recently earned a scholarship from the University of Texas at Austin.
    
    Kids have been worried about what’s going to happen to their school and district in recent weeks, she said, and conversations will likely continue in the classroom when they return next week from spring break.
    
    “I feel like it will be a lot to talk about,” she said.

    <br>
    After years of demanding a state takeover of the Houston Independent School District, Gov. Greg Abbott is finally getting what he wants politically as he pushes to reshape public schools throughout Texas in a much broader way.

    For years, Abbott has called the HISD leadership a joke and a disaster. 
    
    “If ever there was a school board that needs to be taken over and reformed it's HISD,” Abbott said back in 2019.
    
    The TEA’s move comes as Abbott, a Republican, is expending significant political capital on a list of education reforms. If he is successful, those reforms will be a significant part of his legacy as he serves his third term in the governor's mansion.
